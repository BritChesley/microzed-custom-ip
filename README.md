==================

Custom IP project for the MicroZed

### Description

This project instantiates a custom IP peripheral that interfaces to the
Zynq PS as an AXI-lite slave. The custom IP contains a multiplier module
that connects to read/write registers which can be accessed by the PS.
The project is designed for and tested on the MicroZed board.

### Requirements

* Vivado 2016.4
* [MicroZed 7Z010](http://microzed.org "MicroZed 7Z010")

### Installation of MicroZed board definition files

To use this project, you must first install the board definition files
for the MicroZed into your Vivado installation.

The following folders contain the board definition files and can be found in this project repository at this location:

https://github.com/fpgadeveloper/microzed-custom-ip/tree/master/Vivado/boards/board_files

* `microzed_7010`
* `microzed_7020`

Copy those folders and their contents into the `C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2016.4\data\boards\board_files` folder (this may
be different on your machine, depending on your Vivado installation directory).

### License
